Assignment
I created EC2, S3, VPC, EKS through terraform module with the help of Hashicorp registry.
I generalised the module by creating variable.tf module, you can put the value and use in any project
I also called the value from one module to another module by defining output.tf for EKS module.
In my current project, we didn't use service mesh, so i haven't share Istio assignment.
I have intermediate level of knowledge in shell scripting.
We didn't knowledge about helm chart, because of small cluster in my current project.
